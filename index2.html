        <p>
          Second-year interactive design project: social climate control and energy consumption feedback app. Members of a university community would use it provide feedback about air conditioning to building administrators, who could then make energy-saving or comfort improving adjustments accordingly. The design aims to make submitting feedback intuitive and easy while enabling and encouraging further exploration of energy usage data and the implications of A/C energy use. Small in-app rewards allow personalization of the experience and incentivize repeat usage. Comparing buildings and efficiency leaderboards introduce an element of social competition (i.e. engineers vs. artists vs. administrators) and community involvement / interest. Whimsical elements, like crowd-sourced "building announcements" or self-referential (UC Davis is known for its cow scent) graphics express an levity atypical of comparatively sterile utilities apps.
