        <p class = "sweet-justice">
          Second-year interactive design project: climate control and energy use feedback app prototype. Members of a campus community could use it to provide feedback about air conditioning to building administrators, who could then make energy-saving or comfort improving adjustments accordingly. The design aims to make submitting feedback intuitive while encouraging further exploration of energy data and the implications of A/C use. In-app rewards personalize the experience and incentivize repeat usage. Building comparisons and leaderboards introduce social competition (i.e. chemists vs. artists vs. administrators) and get the community involved. We tried to take an "irreverent" approach to app design, using graphics that reflect the hyperbole often used for temperature complaints, poking fun at the school (the cow loading icon references UCD's renowned bovine scent), and allowing users to express themselves through a random crowd-sourced "building announcements" ticker.

        <p class = "sweet-justice">
          An interactive faux-simulation, created for an intro to Processing class in my second year.  Inspired by videos captured from Wal-Marts on Black Friday, stories of Foxconn (Chinese manufacturer of electronics) workers commiting suicide, and Jonatan Söderström's Norrland. Clicking creates goods and generate demand - consumers consume, workers work harder. </p>
