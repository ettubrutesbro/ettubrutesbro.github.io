<!-- CONTENT ADDITION: a new article with 1. specific title 2. filtration categories for classes
      - divs class quad0-x with "x,y" data-dimension attribute
      - even numbered quads are floated left, odd numbered quads are floated right
      - total dimensions should add up to 98, 98
      - quad0 is always the title image (specific styling)....2nd child div of article is named title (?)

        <p> Social Energy Sensing Monument, or SESEME, is a public data visualization object. An embedded microcontroller receives energy data from networked buildings and changes its physical shape to reflect statistics. Hidden variable-color lighting, infrared sensors and an array of conditional behaviors will be used to make encounters with the object maximally responsive and emotive. </p>

      <div class = "quad5 text" data-dimension = "49,39"><p>We are planning to use Bluetooth LE / iBeacon to communicate with nearby mobile devices, allowing users to access a web application that allows detailed exploration of data and
        physical manipulation of the device - a user could look for statistics from an hour ago, and both 
        the web page and monument would change to display them. </p>
        <p> The goal of the project is to create a public interface that can kindle conversations and influence perceptions regarding energy, hopefully leading to more energy-conscious behavior. SESEME is a work in progress - I'm responsible for the industrial design and the interface design (both tangible and digital) and contributed to mechanical part modeling and design. This is a project of the Consumer Energy Interfaces research group, and I work with a team of engineers and behavioral scientists. <span class = "exit"> back to index &nbsp;<img src = "assets/index.svg" /></span>
