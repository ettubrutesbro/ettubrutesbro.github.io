<div id = "dude">SESEME is a physical energy visualization object. An onboard microcontroller communicates with devices that monitor building energy use, then passes corresponding electrical signals to actuators that move physical segments of the object, continually reshaping its silhouette to reflect energy consumption throughout the day. Public user interaction is encouraged by the implementation of numerous sensors, which combined with programmed behaviors make the object appear to be physically and emotively responsive to the presence of people. Bluetooth LE will be used to sense the proximity of smart devices (primarily phones) and invite users into a web application where users can discover energy statistics in detail and peruse different sets of data, with the physical object moving to match their queries. By turning energy data into an event visible in the public environment, and making discovery and exploration of this data maximally responsive and entertaining, we hope to foster new social interactions and perceptions regarding energy consumption.</div></body>
